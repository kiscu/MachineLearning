Gradient Descent For Multiple Variables
Gradient Descent for Multiple Variables

The gradient descent equation itself is generally the same form; we just have to repeat it for our 'n' features:
repeat until convergence:{θ0:=θ0−α1m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))⋅x0(i)θ1:=θ1−α1m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))⋅x1(i)θ2:=θ2−α1m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))⋅x2(i)⋯}

In other words:
repeat until convergence:{θj:=θj−α1m∑i=1m(hθ(x(i))−y(i))⋅xj(i)for j := 0...n}
